# Probability Distributions (prob-distributions) Python Package

This Python package, Probability Distributions, provides a simple  for working with probability distributions. The package includes classes for Gaussian and Binomial distributions, allowing users to calculate mean, standard deviation, probability density function (PDF), visual representation, and more.

## Installation

You can install the package via `pip`. Simply run:

```bash
pip install prob-distributions
```

## Usage

### Gaussian Distribution

The `Gaussian` class allows you to create and analyze Gaussian distributions.

#### Creating a Gaussian Distribution

```python
from prob_distributions import Gaussian

# Create a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1
gaussian = Gaussian(0, 1)
```

### Binomial Distribution

The `Binomial` class allows you to create and analyze Binomial distributions.

#### Creating a Binomial Distribution

```python
from prob_distributions import Binomial

# Create a Binomial distribution with p=0.5 and n=10
binomial = Binomial(0.5, 10)
```
